*

## Decision
*   [2025-08-20 14:42:00] - Embed Dynamic Date Directly into SYSTEM_PROMPT F-String.

## Rationale
*   Per user instruction, the implementation for dynamic dating was changed to embed the `datetime` call directly within the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` f-string. This approach, while setting the date only once at application startup, was the explicitly requested method.

## Implementation Details
*   Modified `app/agents/voice/automatic/prompts/system.py`:
    *   The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable was converted to an f-string.
    *   The placeholder `{current_date}` was replaced with the direct call `{datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")}`.
    *   The `get_system_prompt` function was simplified to remove the `.format()` call, as the date is now embedded directly in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-08-20 13:26:00] - Embed Date into System Prompt and Refactor Timestamp Handling.

## Rationale
*   To simplify the system message structure and ensure the date is always present, the timestamp was embedded directly into the system prompt. This removes the need for a separate timestamp message.

## Implementation Details
*   Modified `app/agents/voice/automatic/prompts/system.py`:
    *   Imported the `datetime` module.
    *   The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is now an f-string that includes the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
*   Modified `app/agents/voice/automatic/__init__.py`:
    *   Removed the separate system message that contained the timestamp, as it is now part of the main `system_prompt`.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 18:35:00] - Implement and populate the Memory Bank.

## Rationale 

*   To maintain project context, track progress, log decisions, and document system patterns effectively across chat sessions and for different modes. This enhances continuity and understanding of the project's evolution.

## Implementation Details

*   Created a `memory-bank/` directory.
*   Created and populated the following files with initial content and project-specific information:
    *   `productContext.md`: Outlines project goal, key features, and overall architecture.
    *   `activeContext.md`: Tracks current focus and recent changes.
    *   `progress.md`: Lists completed and current tasks.
    *   `decisionLog.md`: Records this decision.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Initialized for future use.
*   Updates to these files are timestamped.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 18:37:00] - Modify system instructions in `gemini_live_proxy_server.py`.

## Rationale

*   User request to add a specific instruction for interpreting spoken inputs: "Please interpret all spoken inputs as English, regardless of accent." This is to improve the accuracy and handling of voice input by the Gemini model.

## Implementation Details

*   Added the new instruction string to the `system_instr` variable within the `## Communication Style` section in `gemini_live_proxy_server.py`.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect this change.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 18:43:00] - Refactor function response formatting in `gemini_live_proxy_server.py`.

## Rationale

*   User reported an issue where the Gemini Live API sometimes vocalizes "tool_outputs" during function calls.
*   An external recommendation suggests this occurs if function responses do not use an `output` key within the `response` dictionary of `types.FunctionResponse`.
*   The change aligns the server's function response structure with the API's expectation to prevent this unintended speech output.

## Implementation Details

*   Modified the `process_tool_calls` function in `gemini_live_proxy_server.py`.
*   For every `types.FunctionResponse` instance, the `response` dictionary was changed from `{'some_key': result}` to `{'output': result}`.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect this refactoring.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 21:31:00] - Refactor project into a modular FastAPI application structure.

## Rationale

*   User request to transform the single-file server (`gemini_live_proxy_server.py`) into a well-structured, industry-standard Python server project.
*   The new structure aims for better organization, maintainability, and scalability, especially for adding new tool providers in the future.
*   Ensures current functionality remains identical.

## Implementation Details

*   Created an `app/` directory to house the core application logic.
*   **`app/main.py`**: FastAPI app instantiation, CORS, static file serving (for [`static/client.html`](static/client.html:1)), health check endpoint, WebSocket routing, and application lifecycle management.
*   **`app/core/config.py`**: Centralized configuration loading from environment variables (API keys, model settings, VAD parameters, etc.).
*   **`app/ws/live_session.py`**: Manages WebSocket connections, client communication, keepalive pings, and orchestrates data flow with the Gemini service.
*   **`app/services/gemini_service.py`**: Encapsulates all interactions with the Google GenAI Live API, including session management, system instructions, response modality configuration, and tool call processing.
*   **`app/tools/`**: Directory for managing tool definitions and implementations.
    *   `app/tools/__init__.py`: Aggregates tool declarations and functions from various providers.
    *   `app/tools/providers/juspay/juspay_tools.py`: Contains Juspay-specific tool logic.
    *   `app/tools/providers/another_provider/some_other_tools.py`: Placeholder for future tool providers.
*   **`static/client.html`**: The client-side HTML interface, moved to a dedicated static directory.
*   **`run.py`**: A root-level script to easily run the Uvicorn server for the FastAPI application.
*   All `__init__.py` files created as necessary to define Python packages.
*   The original `gemini_live_proxy_server.py` is now superseded by this new structure.
*   Updated `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` to reflect these changes.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 21:52:00] - Refactor tool handling mechanism for improved scalability and maintainability.

## Rationale

*   The previous method of identifying tools (e.g., Juspay tools) in `app/services/gemini_service.py` by hardcoding names to pass context parameters (`juspay_token`, `session_id`) was not scalable.
*   A new system was needed where tools can declare their own context requirements.

## Implementation Details

*   **Tool Definition Enhancement (e.g., [`app/tools/providers/juspay/juspay_tools.py`](app/tools/providers/juspay/juspay_tools.py:1)):**
    *   Tool definitions were changed from separate lists of declarations and functions to a single list of "rich tool definitions".
    *   Each rich definition is a dictionary containing:
        *   `"declaration"`: The standard Gemini function declaration.
        *   `"function"`: A direct reference to the callable Python function for the tool.
        *   `"required_context_params"`: A new list of strings specifying context parameter names (e.g., `["juspay_token", "session_id"]`) that the tool's function expects.
*   **Tool Aggregation ([`app/tools/__init__.py`](app/tools/__init__.py:1)):**
    *   This module now imports the lists of rich tool definitions from each provider (e.g., `juspay_tools_definitions`).
    *   It populates `all_tool_definitions_map`: A dictionary mapping each tool's name to its full rich definition.
    *   It also creates `gemini_tools_for_api`: A list of `types.Tool` objects (containing only the function declarations) for configuring the Gemini API.
*   **Service Layer Update ([`app/services/gemini_service.py`](app/services/gemini_service.py:1)):**
    *   The `process_tool_calls` function was refactored:
        *   It now uses `all_tool_definitions_map` to retrieve a tool's full definition by its name.
        *   It extracts the `tool_function` and `required_context_params` from this definition.
        *   It prepares an `available_context` dictionary (e.g., from `websocket.state`).
        *   It dynamically builds the `kwargs` for the `tool_function` by combining `fc.args` with the values of `required_context_params` found in `available_context`.
    *   The `get_live_connect_config` function was updated to use `gemini_tools_for_api` when setting up the Gemini session.
*   This change makes the system more extensible, as adding new tools or providers with different context needs only requires updating their respective definition files and potentially the `available_context` in `gemini_service.py` if new context sources are introduced.
*   Updated `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` to reflect this refactoring.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 21:55:00] - Create a dedicated 'system' tool provider for generic utility tools.

## Rationale

*   To better organize tools and separate general utility functions (like `getCurrentTime`) from provider-specific tools (like Juspay analytics).
*   Improves modularity and clarity of the tool structure, aligning with the goal of a scalable system.

## Implementation Details

*   Created a new directory: `app/tools/providers/system/`.
*   Created `app/tools/providers/system/__init__.py`.
*   Created `app/tools/providers/system/system_tools.py`.
    *   Moved the `get_current_time_declaration` and `get_current_time` function from `app/tools/providers/juspay/juspay_tools.py` to this new file.
    *   Defined a `system_tools_definitions` list in `system_tools.py` containing the rich definition for `getCurrentTime` (with an empty `required_context_params` list).
*   Modified `app/tools/providers/juspay/juspay_tools.py`:
    *   Removed the `getCurrentTime` declaration, function, and its entry from `juspay_tools_definitions`.
*   Modified `app/tools/__init__.py`:
    *   Imported `system_tools_definitions` from `app.tools.providers.system.system_tools`.
    *   Added `system_tools_definitions` to the `_register_tool_definitions` call, so system tools are aggregated along with other providers.
*   Updated `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `productContext.md` to reflect this new tool provider structure.
*

## Decision

*   [2025-05-22 22:00:00] - Remove placeholder `another_provider` tool directory and references.

## Rationale

*   User request to remove unused placeholder code to keep the project clean.
*   New providers will be added only when a specific requirement arises.

## Implementation Details

*   Modified `app/tools/__init__.py` to remove commented-out import and registration lines for `another_provider_tools_definitions`.
*   User advised to manually delete the `app/tools/providers/another_provider/` directory and its files ([`app/tools/providers/another_provider/__init__.py`](app/tools/providers/another_provider/__init__.py:1), [`app/tools/providers/another_provider/some_other_tools.py`](app/tools/providers/another_provider/some_other_tools.py:1)) as direct file deletion is not available via tools.
*   Updated `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` to remove mentions of the `another_provider` placeholder.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-05-22 22:26:00] - Create `app/services/__init__.py`.

## Rationale
*   To ensure the `app/services/` directory is correctly recognized as a Python package, maintaining consistency with other package directories and adhering to Python best practices. This was an oversight during the initial refactoring.

## Implementation Details
*   Created an empty file `app/services/__init__.py` with a comment indicating its purpose.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to log this corrective action.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-05-22 23:11:00] - Update, Reformat, Refine Tone, and Add Numeral Instruction to System Prompt in `app/services/gemini_service.py`.

## Rationale
*   User provided a new, detailed system prompt to replace the existing one.
*   Further user feedback indicated the need to reformat the prompt (using `#` for headings, single newlines).
*   Additional feedback requested emphasizing "Warm & Engaging" and "Sensual" personality aspects.
*   User requested an explicit instruction for the AI to use numerals for specific data like percentages, instead of spelling them out.

## Implementation Details
*   The `text` attribute of the `system_instr` variable (a `types.Content` object) in [`app/services/gemini_service.py`](app/services/gemini_service.py:1) was replaced with the new prompt text.
*   The prompt text was then reformatted:
    *   Headings (e.g., "Role & Identity") were changed to use a single `#` prefix (e.g., "# Role & Identity").
    *   Double newlines (`\n\n`) were reduced to single newlines (`\n`) throughout the prompt.
*   The "Personality & Communication Style" section within the prompt was further refined to enhance the "Warm & Engaging" and "Sensual" characteristics.
*   A new instruction was added to the "Personality & Communication Style" section: `"When presenting numerical data, especially percentages or specific figures, use numerals (e.g., "81.33%", "25 units") for precision and clarity, while still adhering to the Indian numbering system for large values (e.g., "₹2.5 lakh")."\n`
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect all these changes.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-05-24 18:29:00] - Implement conditional server startup based on `enableSimpleV2Flow` flag.

## Rationale
*   User request to allow switching between the main modular application (in `app/`) and a simplified single-file application (`v2.py`) via a configuration flag.
*   This provides flexibility for testing or running different versions of the server.

## Implementation Details
*   Read and understood the structure of [`v2.py`](v2.py:1), which is a self-contained FastAPI application.
*   Added a new boolean configuration `ENABLE_SIMPLE_V2_FLOW` to [`app/core/config.py`](app/core/config.py:1).
    *   It defaults to `False`.
    *   It's loaded from the `ENABLE_SIMPLE_V2_FLOW` environment variable.
*   Modified [`run.py`](run.py:1):
    *   Imported `ENABLE_SIMPLE_V2_FLOW` from `app.core.config`.
    *   If `ENABLE_SIMPLE_V2_FLOW` is `True`, `uvicorn.run` now targets `"v2:app"` (referring to the `app` instance in [`v2.py`](v2.py:1)).
    *   Otherwise, `uvicorn.run` targets the default `"app.main:app"`.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect these changes.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-08-23 18:15:00] - Sanitize AI-generated text to prevent TTS from reading markdown.

## Rationale
*   The AI voice assistant was reading markdown syntax (e.g., "###", "---", "|") aloud, creating an unnatural and confusing user experience.
*   A robust, code-based solution was needed to strip this formatting from the text before it reaches the Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, without affecting the UI or causing application instability.

## Implementation Details
*   Modified `app/agents/voice/automatic/processors/llm_spy.py`.
*   The `LLMSpyProcessor` now intercepts `TextFrame` objects and sanitizes the text in-place.
*   A new `_sanitize_text` method was added to this processor. It uses a set of pre-compiled regular expressions to efficiently remove a wide range of markdown syntax, including headings, horizontal rules, and table structures.
*   The `process_frame` method was updated to check for `TextFrame`s and apply this sanitization before passing the frame down the pipeline. This ensures that both the UI and the TTS receive the same, sanitized text, which is the safest and most stable solution.
*   The regex patterns were pre-compiled as a class variable to optimize performance.
*

## Decision
*   [2025-05-24 18:45:00] - Update system prompt in `v2.py` for a more sensual, cheesy, flirty, and expressive personality.

## Rationale
*   User request to modify the AI's personality in the `v2.py` version of the application.
*   The goal is to make the AI more engaging by incorporating specific traits like sensuality, flirtatiousness, cheesiness, and natural vocal expressions (e.g., laughter, amazement).

## Implementation Details
*   Modified the `system_instr` variable in [`v2.py`](v2.py:1).
*   Updated the "Personality" section to:
    *   Enhance "Warm & Engaging" to "Warm, Engaging & Flirty," encouraging a subtly sensual tone, cheekiness, and light flirtatiousness.
    *   Refine "Cheesy & Chill" to emphasize playful, witty banter.
    *   Added a "Naturally Expressive" point, guiding the AI to use natural vocal cues like soft laughs or sounds of amazement sparingly and appropriately.
*   Updated the "Communication Style" section to:
    *   Include a specific instruction to weave in natural expressions (e.g., 'haha', 'ooh', 'wow') when contextually appropriate, to reinforce the playful and engaging personality.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect these changes.
