# Progress & Status

## 1. What Works

- **Remote Tool Integration:** The integration of the `MCPClient` is functional. The voice agent can successfully connect to the remote MCP server, fetch the list of tools, and register them with the LLM.
- **Dynamic Tool Calling:** The agent can correctly identify when a user's request requires a remote tool and can execute the `tools/call` method, passing the necessary arguments and context.
- **Robust Streaming and Parsing:** The `StreamableHTTPTransport` has been refactored to be highly resilient. It now processes streams line-by-line, uses Pydantic for strict data validation against the MCP spec, and correctly parses nested JSON in tool call results.
- **Improved Error Handling:** The transport layer and client now gracefully handle a wide range of exceptions. This includes network errors, HTTP status code errors, and data validation errors. The streaming logic now correctly manages the stream lifecycle during HTTP errors, preventing crashes from race conditions. The client timeout is also now configurable.
- **Context-Aware Sessions:** The system for passing session-specific data (`mcp_context`) via HTTP headers is in place and functional, allowing for authenticated and contextual tool execution.
- **Date-Preserving Summaries:** The summarization prompt has been updated to ensure that dates and time ranges are preserved in conversation summaries.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Data Sanitization/Filtering Layer:** There is currently no mechanism to sanitize the data that flows between the remote MCP server and the LLM. A filtering layer could be developed to redact sensitive information from tool schemas and results before they are exposed to the LLM.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** While the core functionality and error handling are much improved, a full suite of integration tests is needed to validate the end-to-end tool-calling flow with a variety of tools and edge cases, including testing the new error-handling paths.
- **Expanded Content Type Support:** The Pydantic models currently only support `TextContent` from tool results. They could be expanded to handle other types like `ImageContent` or `AudioContent` as specified by the MCP documentation.

## 3. Known Issues & Risks

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** As documented in `activeContext.md`, there is a known risk of exposing sensitive information (from tool schemas and results) to the LLM. This remains the most significant risk.
- **Dependency on Remote Server:** While error handling has been improved, the agent's tooling capability is still entirely dependent on the availability and correctness of the remote MCP server.
